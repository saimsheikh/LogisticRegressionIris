# LogisticRegressionIris


```
implementing logistic regression importing  by default given dataset 'iris'.
thing to see is that we didnt perfrm EDA cuz we have settled all independent features in X_train and 
our dependent feature in y_train, so we know specifically to what classify that's why we dont need any EDA in this example,
but in other lengthy examples EDA must be needed.
